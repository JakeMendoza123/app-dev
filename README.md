The story begins with Peter Parker's life turning upside down after his secret identity as Spider-Man is revealed by Mysterio in the previous film. This revelation brings chaos to Peter's personal and superhero life, with his loved ones facing repercussions.

In desperation, Peter seeks the help of Doctor Strange to erase everyone's memory of him being Spider-Man. However, the spell goes awry, causing multiverse disruptions and bringing villains from alternate realities into Peter's world.
